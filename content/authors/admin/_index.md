#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

# About Me

I’m Emanuele, Ph.D. student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. I am a Doctoral Fellow at the ETH AI Center, and part of the Medical Data Science Lab led by Prof. Julia Vogt.

In my research I enjoy working on diverse problems that span multiple areas of deep learning. A large part of my research studies how to design latent-variable generative models that handle a large set of diversified data modalities, balancing generative quality with semantic alignment and meaningful representations. I also have a strong interest on representation learning and have explored ideas for self-supervised learning, clustering, and modelling hierarches in the data. 

In parallel to methodological research on deep learning, I am motivated by investigating AI applications in the health domain. With the aim of advancing the research in this field, I was an Organizer and Program Chair of the Time Series Representation Learning for Health workshop at ICLR 2023, and the Deep Generative Models for Health workshop at NeurIPS 2023. 

Work aside, I have a passion for making voice and guitar acousitc covers. Otherwise, you’ll probably find me outdoors, enjoying some active time in the fresh air. Right now trying to improve my windsurfing and sailing skills.
